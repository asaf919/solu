## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Program

This project includes **two main execution modes**:

1. **Multithreaded Mode (`main.py`)** ‚Äì Runs all components in parallel for better performance.
2. **Sequential Mode (`main_seq.py`)** ‚Äì Runs components **one by one**, making it easier to debug.

Both modes **print logs to the console** and **store logs in the `debug_output/` directory** for later analysis.
