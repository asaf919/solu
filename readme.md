## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Program

This project includes **two main execution modes**:

1. **Multithreaded Mode (`main.py`)** ‚Äì Runs all components in parallel for better performance.
2. **Sequential Mode (`main_seq.py`)** ‚Äì Runs components **one by one**, making it easier to debug.

Both modes **print logs to the console** and **store logs in the `debug_output/` directory** for later analysis.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Multithreaded Version**
   ```sh
   python main.py --input_video <path_to_input_video>
   ```

- output is stored as an output.mp4 file in the root directory.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Sequential Version**
   ```sh
   python main_seq.py --input_video <path_to_input_video>
   ```

- output is stored as an output.mp4 file in the root directory.
